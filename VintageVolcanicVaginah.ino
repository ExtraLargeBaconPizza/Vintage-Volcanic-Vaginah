    Notes:
    - Cannot use loop in addLeds function because the pin number must be a runtime constant. Gross, I know.
    - Ensure esp32 is grounded to psu, even if powered by seperate usb
    - Ws2815 are unidirectional. You must connect to the female end of the strip to a 4-pin  male JST-SM from the board
    - Parrallel output: - writing to each pixel takes 30Âµs, so FastLED.show() can take while because it has to iterate over all pixels and strips in series (ie one at a time)
                        - parrallel will write to strips in parrallel and must be enabled

    - Backup data line: - Do not wire backup data line to seperate pins. This can cause noise over longer wire lengths, which can result in random flickering
                        - Either wire both data lines to the same pin or wire the backup data line directly to the ground (as close to strip as possible)
